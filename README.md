# best-candidates
Search for the best candidates given a voter's opinions on different topics.

The function Candidates will take two lists. The first is the voters opinions (designated with -1, to disagree, 0 for a neutral stance, and 1 to agree). The second is a list of lists with each nested list containing a candidates name and their opinions (also designated with -1, 0, or 1). The function will output the names of the candidates who best match the voters opinions.
